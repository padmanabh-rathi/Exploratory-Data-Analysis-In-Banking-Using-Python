# Materials and methods:
The dataset we'll use is a subset of the open-source Bank Marketing Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is publicly available for research. For further details, refer to [Moro et al., 2014].

Our objective is to perform a preliminary analysis of positive responses (term deposit subscriptions) to direct calls from a bank. Essentially, this involves a form of bank scoring, where we predict client behavior—such as loan defaults or a willingness to open a deposit account—based on their characteristics.

Through this project, we will aim to answer several key questions relevant to analyzing banking data:

-What proportion of clients were successfully attracted in the dataset?

-What are the mean values of numerical features for these attracted clients?

-What is the average call duration for clients who subscribed?

-What is the average age among attracted, unmarried clients?

-How do average age and call duration vary across different types of employment?

Additionally, we will conduct a visual analysis to help improve the planning of future banking marketing campaigns.
